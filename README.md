## Introduction

This is repository is for the self-directed learnings and guided projects completed. The projects showcase my the breath of my programming language, systems, data pipelines and technological musings--programming is an art form. I am going to organize this repository by primary language governing the project and may in the future restructure the repository based on the business area the repository is associated.
